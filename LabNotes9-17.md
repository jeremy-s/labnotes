Technology alters your phenomenological perception of the world.

Filing systems are a janitorial problem. But not JUST a janitorial problem.

	The way we organize files is related to the way we publish.

Is knowledge production only abstract? No. It has a material component.  
When we think of documents, we think of them as things. Points.  

	What if we thought of them as lines/vectors? (From one brain to another)
		transportation (even electronic), through time
		documents are amorphous, moving, indeterminate
		When is something done moving? Never?

Emails, term papers, etc. have different vector formats. And along with the formats, sets of affordances.

	Persistency, searchability, storage—document type affects this

With so many vectors, control is difficult. That's why companies offer to do it for you.

So when you set something down on paper, you use a proprietary format. And that will have consequences down the road.

Searching across all your documents can be difficult, for example, if you use multiple proprietary formats.

Computer: a machine that can emulate any other machine (Turing).

Idea: you can unify them. Just make them all plaintext files.

	Nonproprietary, easy to search, persistent, easy to archive/disseminate

Encryption is a military tech, legally.

	Password protection is a measure of encryption. But it's not perfect.

Minimal computing: thinking about computing in developing world, with minimal resources

Form & Content. But the closer you poke at it, the more troubled it becomes.
	There is no formless content in practice.

WYSIWYG: OpenOffice, Word, etc. But this requires a subterranean level of markup. wysiNwyg

Writer also performs the job of a typesetter in this format. Introduces huge insufficiency.

The x in .docx = Microsoft tried very hard to make the underneath markup in xml. Meh.

Paragraph is a semantic structure. It can be formatted in a variety of ways.

Html, though, mixes semantic elements (paragraphs) and formatting elements (bold, ital)

Why not have an element that says “emphasis” instead of italics, and let you decide how you want to display emphasis. And foreign language, and direct speech.

	HTML
		gunky
		not especially human readable

semantics/style/content

Markdown wanted to solve these problems: not gunky, separation of semantics/style/content
