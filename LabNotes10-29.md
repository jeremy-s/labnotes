###Turing Machines

A universal TM takes not only symbols but can also take a whole machine as an input.

In Turing's language, a UTM can take in a machine.

Configuration: combo of state and current symbol.

Equivalent of program/software: tape. (Actually, both can be modeled in either hardware or software.) This is how virtual machines operate.

Data vs. program: no difference in this model. Data is program is data.

A Turing machine is a symbol manipulation machine. If you can reduce something to a set of symbols, you can simulate/emulate it with a TM.

###Peer Empowerment with Weasel Words

Find 3 papers. Then convert them into plane text. Then look up weasel words and make a list. Search for those weasel words in your writing. Then replace the weasel words with a substitution that makes sense. Find the lines that you replaced and put them in a separate file.

Don't ever do destructive manipulation of data in place.
